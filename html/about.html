        <h1>About mardi gras</h1>
        <p>
          The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at
          the mouth of the Mississippi River in what is now lower Plaquemines
          Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their
          men celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The
          date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is
          unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music
          and dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing).[2] An
          account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already
          established. Processions and wearing of masks in the streets on Mardi
          Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were
          quickly renewed whenever such restrictions were lifted or enforcement
          waned. In 1833, Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich
          plantation owner of French descent raised money to fund an official
          Mardi Gras celebration. James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the
          South, and Other Miscellaneous Pieces describes New Orleans Mardi Gras
          in 1835:[3] The Carnival at New Orleans, 1885 Shrove Tuesday is a day
          to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for
          fun, frolic, and comic masquerading. All of the mischief of the city
          is alive and wide awake in active operation. Men and boys, women and
          girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert
          themselves to invent and appear in grotesque, quizzical, diabolic,
          horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with
          heads of beasts and birds, beasts and birds with human heads;
          demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes;
          man-bats from the moon; mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers
          parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts, coaches,
          cars, &c., in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly
          shouting, singing, laughing, drumming, fiddling, fifeing, and all
          throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way. In 1856, 21
          businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize
          a secret society to observe Mardi Gras with a formal parade. They
          founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mistick Krewe of
          Comus. According to one historian, "Comus was aggressively English in
          its celebration of what New Orleans had always considered a French
          festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than this parade
          that the lead in the holiday had passed from French-speakers to
          Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New
          Orleans and its Creoles. To a certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized'
          the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of how
          their business prowess helped them construct a more elaborate version
          than was traditional. The lead in organized Carnival passed from
          Creole to American just as political and economic power did over the
          course of the nineteenth century. The spectacle of Creole-American
          Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to compete with Creoles
          in the ballrooms and on the streets, represents the creation of a New
          Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely American."[4] In
          1875, Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday.[5] War,
          economic, political, and weather conditions sometimes led to
          cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the
          American Civil War, World War I and World War II, but the city has
          always celebrated Carnival.[5] The 1898, Rex parade, with the theme of
          "Harvest Queens," was filmed by the American Mutoscope Co.[6][7] The
          rumored but long-lost recording was rediscovered in 2022. The
          two-minute film records 6 parade floats, including one transporting a
          live ox. In December of 2022, the film was deemed "culturally,
          historically, or aesthetically significant" by the National Film
          Registry by the Library of Congress.
